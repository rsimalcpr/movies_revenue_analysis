# movies_revenue_analysis
A data science project to predict movie revenues. The dataset was downloaded from kaggle.

The movie industry is one of the most lucrative in our times, with thousands of movies produced every year, attracting people of all ages to cinemas. This leads us to ask a series of questions: How does this industry work? why do some movies make a lot of money while Others struggle for success? What variables influence the gross? 

Our goal is to try to understand all the factors that can influence the success of a movie and the variables that have an impact on the gross revenues.
The dataset has 15 features with 8 categorical and 7 numerical feature columns. Categorical variables consist of rating, genre, star, writer, director, company, country whereas numerical variables are called score, votes, runtime, budget, gross, year and released. 

After applying several statistical learning methods, we draw the conclusion that 'budget' is the most significant predictor in the prediction of 'gross'. 

This project consists of 4 main parts: data cleaning and preparation, exploratory data analysis, confirmatory data analysis, and statistical-learning-model application.
